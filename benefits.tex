\subsection*{BENEFITS}

This research is aims to unlock the power of sophisticated
computational simulation incorporating uncertainty for
\emph{interactive} use.  Although we concentrate our research on
simulation support for disaster response, the ultimate potential of
this work is to eventually empower domain experts from a broad range
of areas to better use the high-performance computing power which is
now available to them. We envision a future where performing a complex
flood model or disaster simulation is as interactive and \emph{alive}
as flicking through photos on a tablet.

There are several benefits arising from the successful completion of
this project. They include, economic, societal as well as
environmental along with the generation of new knowledge:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduced economic losses from disasters such as flooding
\item Reduced property damage from disasters
\item Reduced loss of life from disasters
\item New knowledge in the understanding of disaster modelling, and
  hence forecasting.
\end{itemize}
