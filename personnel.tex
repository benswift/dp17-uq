\subsection*{ROLE OF PERSONNEL}
% - Summarise the role, responsibilities and contributions of each Chief Investigator (CI) and Partner Investigator (PI)
% - Summarise the roles and levels of involvement of other Participants, for example, technical staff, Research Associates and other personnel
% - Describe how each Participant will ensure they have the ‘time and capacity’ to undertake the proposed research, taking into account any other grants or roles that they hold.

%The personnel on this grant cover the key research areas discussed in
%the \emph{Research Project} section of this application:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \textbf{Steve Roberts}: uncertainty quantification, sparse grids, flood
%  modelling
%\item \textbf{Markus Hegland}: sparse grids
%\item \textbf{Peter Strazdins}: sparse grids, distributed computing
%\item \textbf{Henry Gardner}: HCI, interfaces
%\end{itemize}

The personnel involved in this project will be the CIs Gardner,
Roberts, Strazdins and Hegland, the PIs Jakeman and Debusschere, and
two Postdoctoral Research Associates and four PhD students.  This
project is split between the ANU Research School of Computer Science
(CI Gardner, CI Strazdins, one PDRA, two PhD students) the ANU
Mathematical Sciences Institute (CI Roberts, CI Hegland, one PDRA and
two PhD students), together will support from Sandia National Labs (PI
Jakeman and PI Debusschere).  In addition, we forecast that upwards of
four Honours students will work with this project team over the three
years of the project.

CI Gardner will be responsible for the overall project and will lead
the interactive computing and visual interface components, based on
his expertise in HCI and visualisation.  CI Strazdins will be
responsible for the high performance and distributed computing
components of the project, based on his expertise in high performance
computing.  CI Roberts will lead the inundation modelling, and
uncertainty quantification components, based on this expertise in
computational fluid dynamics and the use of sparse grid based
uncertainty quantification.  CI Hegland will be responsible for the
sparse grid and reduced model component of the project, based on his
extensive expertise in computational mathematics, in particular his
expertise in the analysis of the combination technique for sparse
grids.  PI Jakeman will provide expertise on uncertainty
quantification techniques based on his extensive experience in
applying such techniques to complex modelling problems.  PI
Debusschere will provide his extensive expertise in uncertainty
quantification through to fault tolerant numerical solvers.

One post-doctoral fellow, to be situated in the
Research School of Computer Science (RSCS), will develop large
portions of the live programming tools and software interface which
will interact with the scientific models and will conduct experiments
on live scenarios where human actors mimic the interactions and
information flows involved in the group dynamics of disaster response
with simulation support. Due to the large skill set and responsibilities of 
this position it has been factored into the budget at level B3.
One possible candidate for this position is 
Dr Ben Swift who is currently a post doc in the RSCS and has work 
extensively in HCI and has collaborated extensively with CI Gardner, on work 
relevant to this project ~\parencite{martin2016intelligent,martin2015tracking,swift2014coding,swift2013visual,swift_live_2016}.


The second post-doctoral fellow, to be
situated in the Mathematical Sciences Institute (MSI), will develop
the numerical methods for computing sparse grid surrogates and reduced
basis models which are able to efficiently propagate uncertainties in
model applications of tsunami and flood surge events. This 
position is budgeted at level B1 ( raising to B2 in year 3).
One possible candidate for this position is the current PhD 
student of CI Hegland, Mr Brendan Harding,  who has just 
submitted his PhD thesis on ``Fault Tolerant Computation of
Hyperbolic PDEs with the Sparse Grid Combination Technique''.
Mr Harding has collaborated with his supervisor, 
CI Hegland, along with CI Strazdins and CI Roberts, all
on work relevant to this project~\parencite{deBaarHarding2015,
AliEtal2015,StrazdinsEtal2015,HardingHLS2015,Ali11022016}.


Without prejudicing a competitive selection process, suitable candidates 
are known to be available for both positions.

The four PhD students will be split between the two departments---two
in RSCS and two in MSI, focusing on specific aspects of the project,
essentially aligned with the four CIs areas of responsibility.  In
RSCS, these will be the dynamic distributed computing infrastructure
and the development of live interfaces for data visualisation. In the
MSI, these will be the uncertainty quantification and the development
of numerical methods for the sparse grid technique, and the reduced
basis method, applied to our inundation model example.

We anticipate being able to support a number of Honours projects in
computer science and mathematics during the course of this
project. Some of these projects will relate to the core mission of the
project detailed above, others will concentrate on related studies
with a view to achieving high-impact pure and applied research and
training young people for a career in the computing and mathematical
modelling disciplines.
