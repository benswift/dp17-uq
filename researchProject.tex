\noindent{\bf Significance and Practical Research Challenge:}
Computational modelling and simulation is an invaluable support tool
for disaster response, allowing emergency services personnel to
explore what might happen in the immediate future under various
scenarios. But these model simulations can be fraught with
uncertainty: some of their \emph{input parameters} may be well known
(possibly from reliable sensor data), others may be known only
approximately, and others still may only be guessed at. Even with
perfect input data, the models themselves entail assumptions and
numerical approximations which bound the reliability of their
predictions.

The January 2011 Brisbane River floods in south-east Queensland cost
32 lives and caused 2.5~billion dollars worth of
damage~\parencite{vandenhonert2011}. In the days leading up to these
events, a key issue facing authorities was incorporating their
\textbf{uncertainty} about the preceding fortnight's rainfall and the
forecast rainfall into their modelling. In their report on the causes,
impacts and implications of the floods,  Honert and McAneney \cite{vandenhonert2011}
concluded:
\blockquote{Whilst the dam operators were acting in accordance with the operations manual for the dam, their modeling did not take account of forecast rainfall in determining the predicted dam water level, and this resulted in a sub-optimal water release strategy. Employing tools for decision making under uncertainty would have resulted in a different water release strategy.}

Our ambition is to build models 
and support infrastructure that will ensure that an appropriate range of relevant scenarios
can be explored properly before such decisions are undertaken.

At the other end of the environmental spectrum, bushfire model
predictions are similarly `fraught with
uncertainty'~\cite[p375]{alexanderLimitations2013}.  As Australia's
climate changes and extreme weather events become more common, there
is a significant need for better ways to gather timely insights from
modelling in the presence of uncertainty and to communicate those
insights to decision makers and emergency services.

The aims and topic areas for this project are
shown in Figure 1. We envision a context where real-time and rapidly-varying human demands for 
simulation results will drive the development of appropriate interfaces and modelling infrastructure including uncertainty. 
Such simulations will be running on heterogenous HPC compute systems which, themselves, may need to be optimised and redistributed in real-time because of the volatile nature of the deployed environment. Both layers of the simulation environment will be developed and deployed using live-coding.  

The environmental focus of this project fits into the Science and Research Priority of ``Environmental Change''. Our approach is directed towards the Practical Research Challenge of improving the precision of the environmental modelling of systems undergoing rapid and dramatic change. The dynamic disaster scenarios that we target are thought by many to be increasing in frequency and severity due to climate change.\\
 
 
 
 %We now describe these research topics in more detail with a particular emphasis on the overall project's  three main aims.

\noindent{\bf International collaboration: }
We have already mentioned the active collaboration that we have with researchers at Sandia laboratories in the USA. Uncertainty Quantificaion is a topic of very great interest in the computational science community. Our very novel approach to this problem involving live coding is bound to generate huge interest and further opportunities for international collaboration as this project progresses. Already we have delivered one invited workshop on the Extempore system at the major SC conference in Austin, TX in 2015. \\

\noindent{\bf Dissemination:}
We describe plans for publication below. 
As discussed in the project description and under feasibility, we plan to establish contact with disaster management agencies to scope the human interface needs of users and to engage emergency services personnel as human participants in live-coding experiments. This industry engagement will disseminate our work to these stakeholders and will hopefully lead to downstream collaborations over time.
 Even though we will be concentrating the bulk of our efforts on studying reduced mathematical models,
 as time permits we plan to make our simulations as close to the real-world as possible, including the use of realistic topographic data for flood simulations. This greater realisim is bound to generate much interest in the media and the community. Arising from this interest, we envision that many future projects may involve active collaboration with emergency services and industry across Australia and overseas.

The overall context of our project is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:projcontect}.  . In the application layer, the project
is concerned with developing and delivering simulations with
quantified uncertainty in a time-bound manner under conditions of
rapidly changing human demands. At the systems layer, the project is
concerned with managing large and ambitious simulations, and their
associated data, in emergency disaster management settings where the
very existence of such systems may be volatile. Both of these layers
of concern will be supported by a novel live-coding approach to
software development and prototyping as well as the use of live-coding
for delivered simulations in order to modify and tune them, and their
computational systems in real time.

\subsubsection*{Expected Outcomes}

This project will provide the following discoveries:
\begin{enumerate}

\item a suite of interactive, real-time modelling tools for
  surge-tsunami flood disasters which combine high fidelity
  simulations (fine grids) with low fidelity (coarse grid) simulations
  to quantify uncertainty, optimised for human exploration

\item a `live software engineering' approach to the development,
  deployment and optimisation of these interactive software systems

\item models of group interaction scenarios for decision-making with
  expert modelling support; from these models, we will obtain
  empirical estimates of the time constraints that such scenarios
  impose on software and computer system requirements and the live
  controls needed to run them effectively in volatile contexts

\item interactive information visualisation of simulation predictions
together with uncertainties


\end{enumerate}
