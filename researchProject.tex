The January 2011 Brisbane River floods in south-east Queensland cost
32 lives and caused 2.5~billion dollars worth of
damage~\parencite{vandenhonert2011}. In the days leading up to
these events, a key issue facing authorities was incorporating their
\textbf{uncertainty} about the preceding fortnight's rainfall and the forcast rainfall 
into their
modelling. In their report on the causes, impacts and implications of
the floods, \cite{vandenhonert2011} concluded:
\blockquote{whilst the dam operators were acting in accordance with
  the operations manual for the dam, their modelling did not take
  account of forecast rainfall in determining the predicted dam water
  level, and this resulted in a sub-optimal water release strategy.
  Employing tools for decision making under uncertainty would have
  resulted in a different water release strategy.} At the other end of
the environmental spectrum, bushfire model predictions are similarly
`fraught with uncertainty'~\cite[p375]{alexanderLimitations2013}.
As Australia's climate changes and extreme weather
events become more common, there is a significant need for better ways
to gather timely insights from modelling in the presence of
uncertainty and to communicate those insights to decision makers and
emergency services.

Computational modelling and simulation is an invaluable support tool
for disaster response, allowing emergency services personnel to
explore what might happen in the immediate future under various
scenarios. But these model simulations can be fraught with
uncertainty: some of their \emph{input parameters} may be well known
(possibly from reliable sensor data), others may be known only
approximately, and others still may only be guessed at. Even with
perfect input data, the models themselves entail assumptions and
numerical approximations which bound the reliability of their
predictions.
