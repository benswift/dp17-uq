\subsubsection*{Interactive Design Optimisation}

The methodology we will develop for this project will also have
significant benefits for engineering design. We will explore this in
the context of design optimisation problems from aerospace and
aeronautics. Design optimisation poses a significant challenge due to
the large number of input parameters, for example in describing the
geometry of an airfoil, and there are a number of ways in which
uncertainty comes into the modelling. For example, the manufacturing
process is not exact, and the full range of attack angles, velocities,
stresses and weather conditions the airfoil will be exposed to during
flight can only be guessed at. In this project we will build on our
previous work in applying sparse grid methods in airfoil
design~\parencite{SU2,deBaarHarding2015}, using an interactive
feedback loop to improve the efficiency of the design process within
our live coding and uncertainty quantification framework.
