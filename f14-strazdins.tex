	International Journal of Parallel and Distributed Systems and
      Networks, 4(1), pp.\ 26--35, April 2001. 

First comparison of leading load balancing techniques for parallel
dense linear algebra, also developing formal properties and
performance models. The technique is of continuing relevance, and in
particular for manycore devices such as GPUs. 44 citations, 25 over
the last 5 years. The conference version of this paper (1998) has received
12 citations, making 56 in total.

n.}
                {ANZIAM J.} 42(E), pages C1328--C1355, Dec 2000.

First ever distributed memory parallelization of the LDLT
decomposition.  Proposed and evaluated several algorithms along a
spectrum of performance and numerical stability tradeoffs. Led to a
follow-up paper co-authored by John Lewis from Boeing, a world leader
in the area of numerical algorithms. Cited by 10.

  3 and LINPACK Benchmark on the AP1000}, Fujitsu Scientific and
  Technical Journal, 29(1):61â€“70, 1993.  A collaboration with a
  world-leading computer scientist leading to the first description of
  what later became known as the algorithmic blocking technique for
  matrix factorization; also one of the first papers on parallel BLAS
  implementation. 23 citations.

using the Sparse Grid Combination Technique}, Proceedings of the 2015
International Conference on High Performance Computing \& Simulation
(HPCS 2015), pp499-507, Amsterdam, July 2015.

Culminating paper of a series of papers produced by
LP100200079. Demonstrated that an existing, widely used and highly
complex real-world application running over thousands of processes can
be made robustly tolerant to hard faults. The novelty lies in using a form
of Algorithmic-Based Fault Tolerance to do so (the project was the
first to use it for that purpose).  One of CI Strazdins contributions
was solely devising and implementing the first-ever distributed memory
SGCT algorithm -- a major achievement in its own right.
The technique is applicable to a large
class of scientific simulations, and the project has similarly made
two other major applications fault-tolerant since. 
In recognition of its breakthrough research, it was given the {\bf
  Outstanding Paper Award} at HPCS-15.

Under grant LP100200079.
