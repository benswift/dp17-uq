\subsubsection*{Interactive Visualisation of Environmental Forecasts with Uncertainty}

Similar to the impact of visually presented geodata on decision
making~\parencite{kinkeldey2015evaluating}, the particular
visualisations of uncertainty in our environmental models will need to
be systematically evaluated with human participants. Here we will
adopt traditional human-factors trials with non-expert participants
together with qualitative feedback from emergency services experts. We
will solicit qualitative feedback from expert participants from
emergency authorities in our local area including ACT Emergency
Service, Geosciences Australia, the Australian Maritime and Safety
Authority and the Australian Federal Police. Perspectives offered by
this participant pool will be important in extrapolating our study
results to real world disaster-management.
